You will need to install the [http://get.adobe.com/air/ Adobe AIR Runtime] before you can use Airbob. 

After starting the application the first time Airbob will ask you to enter the url to your cruise control server. If the url to your cruise control dashboard is the following:

  * http://yourserver.org:8080/dashboard 

then you will need to enter this url (including "http://" without "dashboard"): 
  
  * http://yourserver.org:8080

If your server url is correct then the list of projects will appear in seconds.

The focus on the next release will be to make the application easier to use.
