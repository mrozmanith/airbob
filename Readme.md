## Configuration ##

You will need to install the [Adobe AIR Runtime](http://get.adobe.com/air/) before you can use Airbob.

After starting the application the first time Airbob will ask you to enter the url to your cruise control server.
If the url to your cruise control dashboard is the following:

  * http://yourserver.org:8080/dashboard

then you will need to enter this url (including "http://" without "dashboard"):

  * http://yourserver.org:8080

If the url is correct, then the list of projects will appear in seconds.

## Favorites ##

Clicking on the favorites star in the top right corner toggles between the full view of your projects and the favorites view. You can hide/show projects in the full view mode.

New projects are by default visible in your favorites view.
